This project is only a sample to look and recreate your own rest-api with concepts from this project.
It is not the super simple version, but it's not the most complex either.
It has clean structure for better understanding.

Starting point for this project is server.js which imports app.js containing all the logic

follow the following steps to create your own services

1 create model
2 create service
3 create router
4 import and use the router in app.js

NOTE: This project can be massively improved. I have kept it simple for the ease of understanding for beginners.
