In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.

## Declaration of an Array ##
There are two ways to declare an array.                                                                                                                                           var House = [ ];              //method no. 1                                                                                                                                        var House = new Array();      //method no. 2 

## Initialization of an Array ##
Example (for Method 1):                                                                                                                                                           // Initializing while declaring                                                                                                                                                   var house = ["1BHK", "2BHK", "3BHK", "4BHK"];
Example (for method 2):                                                                                                                                                           // Initializing while declaring                                                                                                                                                   // Creates an array having elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50                                                                                                                            var house = new Array(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      //Creates an array of 5 undefined elements                                                                                                                                        var house1 = new Array(5);                                                                                                                                                          //Creates an array with element 1BHK                                                                                                                                                var home = new Array("!BHK");


An array in JavaScript can hold different elements 
We can store Numbers, Strings and Boolean in a single array. 
Example:                                                                                                                                                                          // Storing number, boolean, strings in an Array                                                                                                                                  var house = ["1BHK", 25000, "2BHK", 50000, "Rent", true]; 


## Accessing Array Elements ##
Array in JavaScript are indexed from 0 so we can access array elements as follows:
var house = ["1BHK", 25000, "2BHK", 50000, "Rent", true];                                                                                                           alert(house[0]+" cost= "+house[1]);                                                                                                                                             var cost_1BHK = house[1];                                                                                                                                                          var is_for_rent = house[5];                                                                                                                                            alert("Cost of 1BHK = "+ cost_1BHK);                                                                                                                                             alert("Is house for rent = ")+ is_for_rent);

## Length property of an Array ##
Length property of an Array returns the length of an Array. Length of an Array is always one more than the highest index of an Array. 
Example below illustrates the length property of an Array:
var house = ["1BHK", 25000, "2BHK", 50000, "Rent", true];                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           //len contains the length of the array                                                                                                                                            var len = house.length;                                                                                                                                                         for (var i = 0; i < len; i++)                                                                                                                                                          alert(house[i]);
