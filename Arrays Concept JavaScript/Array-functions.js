/** 1: This is How You create an Array */

let Names=['Aslam' , 'Ali' , 'Asadullah']

///by doing console.log you will be able to see whole Array
console.log(Names);

/** You can see above you don't need any thing extra create the variable and assign the array */






/* 2: How exactly do you check the length of an array?  */

//Here is how

console.log(Names.length);

//Above console.log will output 3 , as we have declared our array with 3 values




/* 3: How to access array values ? */

/*

    You can access value of an array  by passing Index of value you want to access 
    Like If we want to access "ALI" we will need pass 1 to access ALI


*/

console.log(Names[1])

//Above console log will output "Ali"







//MORE FUNCTIONS WILL BE ADDED AS WELL SOON
