<!-- What is Vue Exactly? -->
<!-- Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. 
    Unlike other monolithic frameworks, 
    Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. 
    The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to
     pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. 
    On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated 
    Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries. -->

    <!-- THis is the Only DIV which is required to run the whole VueJs app
        we have given div below an id="app" , and we have used here text interpolation to render values dynamically
         "{{}}" in between we have 
        rendered our variable which is declared in script section
        -->
    <div id="app">
      <div>
        <p>Displaying Just Message below</p>
        <h1>{{ message }}</h1>


        <!-- How you can create and call the methods? -->
        <!-- This statement with message1 will just print the message like we did in above h1 -->
        <p>Here we see how we can reverse the message</p>
        <p>{{ message1 }}</p>
        <!-- In below we are calling referseMessage function which is defined in script and it reverses our text -->
        <button v-on:click="reverseMessage">Reverse Message</button>

        <!-- Now we will see how we can use conditions like (if , else if) -->

        <p>we will show and hide our message below</p>
        <!-- He we are using v-if to check the condtion , if thats true than show that h2 , else hide it, showHide variable is declared in data -->
        <h2 v-if="showHide">I am Hidden as well as showen</h2>
        <span>Click on button below to show and hide Message</span>
        <br>

        <!-- And below on button click we are calling toggle methods which changes showHide to true 
          if its already false, else it makes false to true if its hidden

          and also we are showing out text inside based on conditon, like if you want the value to be seen it shows "SHOW" on button , else "Hide"
        -->
        <button v-on:click="toggle">{{ showHide ? "Hide" : "Show" }}</button>
